            <h2>Chapter 1: The Digital Nervous System</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding how information flows through organizations at digital speed, enabling rapid decision-making and competitive advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. The importance of the “digital nervous system” — Bill Gates explains that information is the lifeblood of any organization, and companies must use technology to create a fast, integrated, intelligent flow of data, similar to a human nervous system.</p>
            <p>
                2. Information as a competitive advantage — Winning companies will be those that collect, organize, and use information efficiently to improve processes, anticipate trends, understand customers, and respond quickly to the market. </p>   
            <p>
                3. Historical and practical examples — The chapter highlights Alfred Sloan (General Motors) as a pioneer in using structured information for decision-making, showing that a solid data infrastructure drives innovation and competitive strength.</p>
            <p>
                4. Empowering knowledge workers — Technology should make data accessible at all levels of the company, especially to middle managers, enabling faster, more accurate, fact-based decisions instead of bureaucracy or guesswork.</p>
            <p>
                5. The role of internal digitalization — Moving from paper to digital systems improves processes, reduces costs, and frees employees for more valuable work; when information flows naturally, companies operate with greater intelligence, agility, and customer focus.</p>
