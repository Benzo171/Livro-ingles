            <h2>Chapter 5: The Future of Digital Business</h2>
            <p>
                Exploring emerging trends from AI to IoT, and preparing for continuous adaptation in the digital economy.</p>
            <p>
                The text argues that the digital age is transforming business, society, and the way people work. Customers benefit most from technological efficiency, and companies that adopt digital tools faster than their competitors gain a major advantage. Technology should not be used just for innovation’s sake, but to simplify processes, modernize organizations, and enable faster decision-making. Employees need access to real-time information to take responsibility and act creatively, because centralized control can no longer keep up with the speed of modern business. Digital systems should connect all data, processes, partners, and customers, creating a fully integrated “digital nervous system.” The text also highlights that humans have always advanced through tools, and digital tools now expand our mental abilities just as industrial tools expanded physical abilities. By embracing the digital era proactively, society can improve services, reduce costs, encourage citizen participation, and address challenges like privacy and digital inequality. Ultimately, the success of this transformation depends on leaders who empower people, invest in technology, and encourage innovation.</p>
